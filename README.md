# Visual Argument

In this project, I am creating a flyer to inspire women and non-binary people to get into the field of computer science. From personal experience, I have seen that this is a largely male-dominiated field, with not the most welcoming feeling for others. The problem is not the women/non-binary, it is the environment created around the field and its lack of support for these other genders. The hope is with my flyer, people who are considering the field but feel discouraged by the community end up feeling motivated to enter it. In addition, I hope to catch the attention of men, not so that I can shame/blame them for dominating this field, but in a way that reminds them to be open and encouraging of the other genders that they encounter in the field. This will hopefully show them that all genders can coexist happily in the field.

I decided to implement Kawasaki's principal of repetition to this flyer. I used multiple photos of other genders engaging in computer science-related activities to show that they are not exclusive to men. This repetition created a unified and conhesive look within my flyer and further solidified my argument that computer science should not be a male dominated field.
